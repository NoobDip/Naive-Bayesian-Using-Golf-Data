# Naive-Bayesian-Using-Golf-Data

This repository contains two Jupyter Notebooks for analyzing and processing a golf dataset. The dataset is related to golf play and includes various environmental and time-related features.

## Files

1. **ML_1_NaiveBayesan.ipynb:**
   - Implements a Naive Bayes classifier for the golf dataset.
   - Includes functions for Bayesian calculations, Naive Bayes classification, and testing the model's accuracy.

2. **Golf_Dataset_Correction.ipynb:**
   - Handles data loading, manipulation, and cleaning for the golf dataset.
   - Performs operations such as dropping columns, creating binary columns based on conditions, and cleaning data.

## Data

- The original dataset is stored in 'golf_dataset_wide_format.csv'.
- The cleaned and modified dataset is saved as 'golf_dataset.csv' after data manipulation in the second notebook.

## Usage

1. Open `ML_1_NaiveBayesan.ipynb` for implementing and testing the Naive Bayes classifier.
2. Open `Golf_Dataset_Correction.ipynb` for data loading, manipulation, and cleaning.

## Requirements

- The notebooks are developed using Python, and it's recommended to use them in a Jupyter Notebook environment.
- Required Python libraries are specified within the notebooks.

## Acknowledgments

- This work is part of a machine learning lab and is for educational purposes.

Feel free to explore the notebooks and adapt the code to your needs!
